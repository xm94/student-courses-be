# Integrating External APIs

For your final assignment, you will be integrating an external API into this full stack application. Please reference https://github.com/xm94/dynamic-routes-next for the frontend repo.

## Assignment

You have a full stack app that retrieves students and the courses they are enrolled in from your database, and the students would like a page where they can see their full class schedule with course details and required materials. However, your app only provides the student's their own information and the course IDs of the courses they're enrolled in.

To solve this, an API with the course info is available for you to pull data from - https://courses-be-83kp.onrender.com/courses - where sending the course ID will return information based on the endpoint used. API documentation will be provided to you in PDF form.

## Goal

Please set up a page where a student can see all of the courses they are taking, along with the description of that course and the materials needed for that course.
